# Project Infion

Infion is a cluster manager aimed at management of the clusters consisting
of bare metal/virtual machine nodes/container nodes.

Infion is capable of detecting underlying virtual machines/containers
running on the nodes and is able to interact directly with them hence allowing
the users to interact directly with the underlying unhidden nodes.
